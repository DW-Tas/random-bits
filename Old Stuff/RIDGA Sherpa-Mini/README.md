# RIDGA sherpa-mini
This is a mod of Churls work from Annex Engineering https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Extruders/Sherpa_Mini/Extruder_Mods/Churls-Mini_RIDGA

It has been changed to work with the 3mm bearings that come with a Bondtech RIDGA kit and not have the issues with gears not fully overlapping.
